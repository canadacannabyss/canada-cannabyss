          Lost or undelivered packages are not the responsibility of Canada
          E-Cigs, and any issues arising from packages not received must be

          E-Cigs strives in the upkeep and resolution of such matters, and any
          erroneous shipping issues must be reported within 24 hours of the last

        </P>
        <P>
